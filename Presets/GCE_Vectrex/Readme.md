These are presets for the GCE Vectrx. The default presets use a generic Mega Bezel themed screen overlay.

There are Game Overrides for both the Standard and Advanced Presets that are set up to use the common community Vectrex screen overlays. The main difference between the Standard and Advanced is that the console can scale and has a separate, replaceable background in the Advanced.

Simply copy the VecX folder of your choice to your "config" folder and, as long as your ROM names are the same as mine, they will just work.

I have tweaked some Grade glow and persistence and have the Gel layer configured the way I like it. Feel free to tweak as you wish.

Here is a screenshot.
