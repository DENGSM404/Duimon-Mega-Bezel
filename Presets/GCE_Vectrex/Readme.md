There are Game Overrides for both the Standard and Advanced Presets. The main difference is that the console can scale and has a separate, replaceable background in the Advanced.

Simply copy the VecX folder of your choice to your "config" folder and, as long as your ROM names are the same as mine, they will just work.

I have tweaked some Grade glow and persistence and have the Gel layer configured the way I like it. Feel free to tweak as you wish.
