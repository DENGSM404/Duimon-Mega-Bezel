# Overlay-Hybrid

These are meant to be used as a traditional RA overlay using my Basic_Reflect presets underneath.

Instead of setting the RA video aspect to your monitors aspect, set it to 4x3. This increases shader performance on less powerful systems by reducing the viewport size.

They should work OTB, and you won't need to set any custom veiwport size, the shader handles all the scaling.

The example override assumes you are using the Beetle PSX HW core and that your ROMs are in a folder named "PS1".
