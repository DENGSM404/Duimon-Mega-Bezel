# Overlay-Hybrid

These are meant to be used as a traditional RA overlay using the HSM shader underneath.

Instead of setting the RA video aspect to your monitors aspect, set it to 4x3. This increases shader performance on less powerful systems by reducing the viewport size.

They should work OTB but you may have to use explicit aspect mode at 4x3 (In the shader parameters) on some systems.
