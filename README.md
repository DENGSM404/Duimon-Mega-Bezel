# HSM-Reflection-Shader-Graphics

## 4K System graphics created specifically for use with the HSM Reflection Shader.

This project is an attempt to provide end users with high quality art to use in conjunction with the amazing **HSM Bezel Reflection Shader** created by **HyperspaceMadness**.

While developing this art I have a few select goals.

* All art will be vector based with the exception of native relative raster effects at 300dpi
* High quality is a must! When using existing art as a reference, it will be paired with photographic references in an effort to improve it.
* Raster output of 4K at 300dpi
* all project files will be provided. Layer structure within the project files will assume that an end user may want to change the bezel size or placement, and attempt to make balancing the artwork easy.
